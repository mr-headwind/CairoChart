 DESCRIPTION
 -----------
    This is a package for developers.

    Cairo Chart Kit is a framework source kit that provides a means to easily create and incorporate
    a number of charts into your application using Cairo graphics. At its core are a number of utility
    functions and framework code segments that you include into your package source directory. You insert
    framework calls into your existing code and these call utility functions to set up and draw required charts.
    You may also alter and tweak any code to better suit your requirements if desired.

    There is a skeleton code structure provided that may be used as a basis for your control code if desired.
    However the best way to learn how to use the framework is to compile and run the demo program 
    which sets up and displays each type of chart and then review the code for these - the framework
    calls are highlighted throughout.

    The following charts are available: Pie chart, Bar chart and Line graph.

    The code is all written in c.

 INSTALL
 -------

 DISTRIBUTION PACKAGE
 --------------------
    Since the Cairo Chart Kit is a developer package installation may vary according to your needs.
    You could download the source package and incorporate it directly into your project if desired, 
    but the best option would probably be to download and place it in its own directory 
    (eg. $HOME/Development/CairoChart). Then compile and run the demo and copy all relevant code
    across to your target application.

    Download the latest distribution archive from here: 
    	https://github.com/mr-headwind/CairoChart/tree/master/DIST_PACKAGES 

    Start a terminal or xterm session
    cd $HOME/Development/CairoChart (or your download directory)
    tar xvzf CairoChartKit-x.xx.tar.gz (where x.xx is the version number)
    
    See instructions for compiling and running the demo.

 DEPENDENCIES
 ------------
    Given that this is a package for developers, dependency problems are unlikely, although it is
    possible cairo may need to be installed. 
    The GTK+ 3.0 libraries need to be installed and, for the most part,
    will likely already be present. However if there is a problem try:
    	sudo apt-get build-dep libgtk-3-dev 
	sudo apt-get update
    	sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev
